> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- GitLab testing was fine and tested parts that should be familiar to anyone who does a bit of programming.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- Firstly I watched videos and instructions on Canvas. Then I download folder with instructions and project. Examples were really useful, and I easily understood, how to make test cases. I was working step by step so: documentation, Precondition, Postcondition, Tags, Variables and Test cases. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
- I don't have any special recomendations.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Code

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Only missunderstunding could be, that I didn't know if should I write all words in steps with starting capital letters or not. This was in the example little inconstant.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- No trouble. I used GitHub before in my home university and when I was learning programing.
 


## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Selenium, it is really wide-spread and also on my home university, we have optional courses, where we can learn, how to use Selenium.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking, Adaptability and Flexibility, Effective Communication and Collaboration, Attention to Detail and Precision, Knowleadge of Programming and Scripting Languages, Automated Testing Frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Appium, Cypress)



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Attention to Detail and Precision, Automated Testing Frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Appium, Cypress)




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- For me this study was really teoretical. This is only one assignment, that is practical and we are just writing test cases as text. I would like to have more practical projects, where we can learn how to make automatic testing for example in Selenium.
